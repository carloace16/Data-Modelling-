The subsequent query utilizes a Common Table Expression (CTE) named StockAnalysis to analyze stock levels of products categorized by subcategory and location. It applies dbo.EvaluateRestockingPriority to evaluate the restocking priority for each item. The results include attributes such as SubcategoryName, ProductName, LocationName, StockLevel, and RestockingPriority, providing valuable insights into inventory management. The query orders the results by SubcategoryName, RestockingPriority, and StockLevel for improved clarity."
