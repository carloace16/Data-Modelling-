                "- Before ChatGPT: The original query on the \"Sales.[Order]\" table utilizes set operations, focusing on CustomerId and EmployeeId columns. It begins by selecting distinct pairs for January and February 2016 orders, followed by INTERSECT to retain common pairs. The EXCEPT operation then eliminates 2015-associated pairs, refining the result set. Finally, an ORDER BY arranges output in descending order based on CustomerId and EmployeeId, ensuring clarity in the presented information. This approach efficiently combines set operations to filter and organize data based on specific conditions, yielding a concise and clear output.\r\n",
                "- After ChatGPT: The query employs a series of set operations to achieve the desired result. It begins by selecting distinct pairs of CustomerId and EmployeeId for orders placed in January 2016 and February 2016. The INTERSECT operation ensures that only common pairs between the two sets are retained. Following this, the EXCEPT operation eliminates pairs associated with order activity in the year 2015. The final result set is ordered in descending order based on CustomerId and EmployeeId.\r\n",
                "- **What's Special:** This SQL code uniquely combines set operations to efficiently filter and organize data, providing a clear and refined output. By using INTERSECT to identify common pairs and EXCEPT to exclude undesired pairs, the query ensures a precise list of customer and employee combinations meeting the specified date criteria. The ordering in descending order adds a further layer of clarity to the result set, creating a concise representation of the desired information.\r\n",
